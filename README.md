Recreation of the Atari classic


This is a recreation of the Atari game asteroids for my Fundamentals of Computing class.  The game recreates the movement, and momentum of the original video games, and features a firing feature.  however, as this is just a test of the engine, there are no asteroids to shoot during gameplay.  Enjoy!
